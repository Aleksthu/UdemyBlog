# UdemyBlog
A simple blog website that lets you write and read posts using Node.js, EJS and MongoDB. Made following a Udemy tutorial.

The css and layout was pre-created by tutor, in the tutorial I learned to send the posts you write to a mongoDB database and then retrieve the posts to show them on the home page. The post will then show a maximum of 100 characters of the post, to see the rest you can click read more, where a new page will be created for the selected post.
